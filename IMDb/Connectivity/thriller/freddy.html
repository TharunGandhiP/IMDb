          <h2 class="des">Description</h2>
          <p class="des-des">Dr. Freddy Ginwala is a shy and socially awkward dentist in Mumbai. He goes on multiple dates with women, only to get rejected everytime. His only friend is his pet turtle, Hardy, and also spends his leisure time working on his miniature planes. When he was a child, his father had killed his mother and then committed suicide himself. His aunt Persis has been his guardian since then.

At a relative's wedding, Freddy sees a girl named Kainaaz and awkwardly approaches her to talk to her, but is pushed away by her husband Rustom, who was handling the catering for the wedding. Kainaaz meets Freddy at his clinic the next day, saying she wants to extract her wisdom tooth, and he carries out the surgery the next day. </p>
