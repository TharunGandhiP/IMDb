          <h2 class="des">Description</h2>
          <p class="des-des">In 1944, Dr. Roy Jamnadas (Murali Sharma), who is working on the theory of nature vs nurture, separates two sets of identical twins he finds at the doorstep of the orphanage he runs and gives them up for adoption to two different families, based in two different cities. One pair is given to a couple in Ooty and the other pair to a couple in Bangalore, and both the couples name them Roy and Joy, after Dr. Roy and his own adoptive brother Joy. Roy 1 (Ranveer Singh) and Joy 1 (Varun Sharma)'s father runs a circus and after his death, they both take up the responsibility of running the circus. Roy 2 and Joy 2's father is a rich industrialist. Roy 1 has a strange connection with electricity and electric currents do not affect him. He uses this ability to show tricks at the circus and becomes famously known as 'Electric Man'. Elsewhere, Roy 2 receives electric shocks whenever Roy 1 comes into contact with electricity</p>
