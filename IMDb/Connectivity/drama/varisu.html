Vijay Rajendran, the youngest son of an eminent entrepreneur, Rajendran Palanisamy, is disowned and thrown out of the house as he refused to join the family business, instead deciding to launch a food delivery startup. Seven years later, Rajendran is diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer and has only about 8-10 months to live. He decides to reveal his terminal condition and anoint one of his two elder sons, Jai or Ajay, as his successor, before his impending death. With this in mind, Rajendran plans to celebrate his 65th birthday in a grand manner.</p>
